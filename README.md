# php-utils - Generic utils PHP classes (DRY) :D

## ToDo:

* Create (more) tests
* Add CI and releases
* Create brief doc for every class and function

## Lib usage

Get the lib using composer

```bash
$ composer require mediadata-tv/php-utils
```

No further config is needed, all lib functions expose static methods

## Test

You need to have docker install in order to run tests.
After cloning this repository the test can be runned using the `docker-test.sh` script

```bash
$ ./docker-test.sh
```
